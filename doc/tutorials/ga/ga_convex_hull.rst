Determination of convex hull with a genetic algorithm
=====================================================

Here we will determine the convex hull of a binary alloy.

We use Vegard's law (interpolation) to take care of the lattice constant.

An extension to the tutorial could be to fix the lattice constant and run with a few bulk layers. This way it is a true surface alloy.
